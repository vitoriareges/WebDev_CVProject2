      <p>Hello,
      <br>
      I am Vitoria Regia Oliveira. Currently i am doing a Higher Diploma in CCT. 
      <br>
      <br> Personal info:  
      <br>
      Email: vitoriareges@hotmail.com
      <br>
      Student number 2019153.
      <br></p>

      <p> Info about this CA:
        <br>
        I have tested this website on  the following browsers:
        <br>
        Mozilla;
        <br>
        Explorer;
        <br>
        Chrome;
        <br>
        <br>
        To build this site, i had to use CSS (style), HTML, javascript and PHP.
        <br> I have hosted this site on <a href = "https://riotous-waist.000webhostapp.com/" >000webhost.com</a>
        <br> Althought i built my own database in 000webhost to connect with this website login system, when using it in the hostsite, it did not work unfortunatelly.</p>
        <p>
          As an outcome of this assignment, it was possible to learn first of all that building an website requires lots of patient and passion<br>
          Secondly, there are an infinite of possibilities to design and develop functions to achieve the desired outputs in an website. 
          <br> If i had a chance to start this website from the begining i would have used more div to divide the sections of content in the pages<br>
